For more information about Markdown syntax, see the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
```sh
cd ~/Desktop/my-first-repository
```

Create a virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -n my-first-env-fall-2025 python=3.11
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
conda activate my-first-env-fall-2025
```

Install package dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The stocks functionality requires an AlphaVantage API key. Obtain a premium AlphaVantage API Key (using the [form](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) or shared by the prof).

Create a local ".env" file and store your environment variable in there:

```sh
# this is the ".env" file...

ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY="______________"
```




## Usage


Game of rock, paper, scissors:

```sh
python app/rps.py

# alternative "modular style" command:
python -m app.rps
```

Stocks dashboard:

```sh
python -m app.stocks
```


## Testing

Run tests:

```sh
pytest
```

### Web App

Run the web app (then view in the browser at http://localhost:5000/):

```sh
# Mac OS:
FLASK_APP=web_app flask run

# Windows OS:
# ... if `export` doesn't work for you, try `set` instead
# ... or set FLASK_APP variable via ".env" file
export FLASK_APP=web_app
flask run
```
